# MKS21X -- formerly "javadog"
javadog is my apcs repo written in java!

feel free to look through my (really bad) labs

### notes (starting from 11/16/2017)
~~my notes written on a blank txt file -- feel free to look through them~~
my notes are a historical archive of a time when I wrote about three lines of "notes" for a full lecture -- i use a notebook now


## **Lab Overview**

### 00n/a
[x] there was no lab 0 -- this just relieves my 0-index anxiety

### 01SuperArray
[x] basic reconstruction of ArrayList<String>
[x] binary search algo

### 02OrderedSuperArray
[x]extends SuperArray.java from lab01
[x] throw exception
blueprint for an alphabetized SuperArray
used binary search insertionSort to add strings into the right place

### 03WordSearch
file scanning and reading
try except blocks -- i absolutely abused these to avoid hard coding cases
Math.random()
random.nextInt()

adds as many words as possible from an external file onto a char arry in random orientations (much like a real wordsearch).
imported random to make random-seeds
consistency in random-seeds
